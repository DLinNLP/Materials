### Preparatory Materials

The summer school is planned to target both novices and established practitioners. The keynote speakers are outstanding researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. We are sure that their inspiring lectures would be of interest to all participants.

The lectures are going to be self-contained. If you like to be more prepared, we would suggest reading about linear algebra and automatic differentiation. Two suggestions are:

* https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py

As for practical sessions, we require participant to have some knowledge of Python and programming in general. In order to master PyTorch, it would be useful for the participants to have knowledge of the Python library, Numpy. One way to get started would be to read through the document in the below link:
